# Stable Diffusion
Stable Diffusion is a model from the stability IA company that generates images from text. It is based on the diffusion model.
There ar Base models, checkpoints and Loras that you can use to generate images with different styles and themes.

## What is a base model in Stable Diffusion?
Base models are the models that the company trained to generate images. You can use the base models to generate images with different styles and themes.

## What is a checkpoint in Stable Diffusion?
Checkpoints are the models that the company trained to generate images with a specific style or theme. You can use the checkpoints to generate images with a specific style or theme.

## What is Loras in Stable Diffusion?
Lora is a more specific model than the base models and checkpoints. Loras are models that the company trained to generate images with a specific style or theme. You can use the Loras to generate images with a specific style or theme.

## Interfaces for Stable Diffusion
There are a lot of interfaces that you can use to generate images with Stable Diffusion.

### Fooocus
Fooocus is a interface that you can use to generate images with Stable Diffusion. It is a very simple and easy to use interface that you can use to generate images with Stable Diffusion.\

### Automatic 1111
Automatic 1111 is a interface that you can use to generate images with Stable Diffusion. It is a more complex interface than Fooocus, but it is also very easy to use.

### Forge
Forge is a interface that you can use to generate images with Stable Diffusion. It is like Automatic 1111, but it is better.

### ComfyUI
ComfyUI is a GUI for modulating the diffusion models. It is a open source project that can be used in any project. We can use Models from Stability IA, Flux, in ComfyUI. More dificult to use than the others, but more powerful.
