# Prompt engineering

Prompt engineering is the process of creating a prompt that will generate the desired output from a model. 
This process is crucial for getting the best results from a model, as the prompt is what guides the model in generating the output.

Fewer details means means more variety, but less control. Make clear wich relationship or details are important to you. Considering:
* **Theme:** Person, character, place, object.
* **Medium:** Photo, painting, Ilustration, sculpture, doodle.
* **Setting:** Indoors, outdoors, on the moon, underwater, in the city
* **Lighting:** Soft, ambient, cloudy, neon, studio lights
* **Color:** Vibrant, muted, bright, monochrome, colorful, black and white, pastel
* **Mood:** Thoughtful, calm, exuberant, energetic, melancholic, happy, sad
* **Componsition:** Portrait, headshot, close-up, bird's eye view, full-body, landscape
* **Aspect ratio:** 1:1, 4:3, 16:9, 9:16, 3:4

**THE CLOSER A WORD IS TO THE FRONT, MORE EMPASIS IT WILL HAVE.**
 examples:
 * cat, angry = cat will have more
 * angry cat = angry will have more emphasis

Sample of good prompt:  
`An ilustration of a cat, relaxed, in a city, in vibrant colors, full-body view, at golden hour, with a 16:9 aspect ratio.`
