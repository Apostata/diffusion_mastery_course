## Anime to picture

The process is the same as the `Picture to anime` but you need to add some extra prompt to the positive prompt cause the description generated by the `Describe` tab is too simple when getting from a anime image. Then change the `Preset` to `initial` in the advanced checkbox, also include in the style tab `Fooocus Photograph`.

this is a sample of generate description from a anime image : `there is a young woman posing for the camera`\
and this is a better prompt to generate a image from a anime image: `photo of a young woman, arkan blue eyes, blond hair, freckles, wearing a black leather jackect and a white cropped, posing for the camera`
